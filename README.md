# Investigating Misinformation: Analyzing Social Media to Identify Fake News

My research work on identifying fake news using deep learning models (LSTM, RNN, and transformers) can be accessed in this repository. My work was initially based on a broad exploration of predictive modeling to identify misinformation on social media, but it has since moved to a comparative analysis of particular deep learning methods. The models can use current natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect and prevent fake news, as proven by a variety of literature studies. 

This is a work in progress with the goal of adding to the current discussion around effective misinformation detection.
